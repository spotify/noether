/**
 * Compute the average NDCG value of all the predictions, truncated at ranking position k.
 * The discounted cumulative gain at position k is computed as:
 *    sum,,i=1,,^k^ (2^{relevance of ''i''th item}^ - 1) / log(i + 1),
 * and the NDCG is obtained by dividing the DCG value on the ground truth set. In the current
 * implementation, the relevance value is binary.
 * If a query has an empty ground truth set, zero will be used as ndcg

 * IR evaluation methods for retrieving highly relevant documents. K. Jarvelin and J. Kekalainen

 * @param k the position to compute the truncated ndcg, must be positive
